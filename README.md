# H-index-Prediction
The goal of this data challenge is to study and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques
to a real-world regression problem. In this regression problem, each sample corresponds to a researcher
(i. e., an author of research papers), and the goal is to build a model that can predict accurately the
h-index of each author. More specifically, the h-index of an author measures his/her productivity and
the citation impact of his/her publications. It is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given
author has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
